## Overview

CRIS (**Cryptographic RSA Image Steganography**) is a Python-based tool that securely hides files within images using **RSA encryption** and **steganography**. By scattering encrypted file bytes across an imageâ€™s pixels, CRIS ensures secure data embedding and retrieval, making it useful for covert data storage and transmission.

## Key Features

- **RSA Encryption**: Encrypts a seed used for shuffling byte placements within the image.
- **Shuffling Mechanism**: Ensures data is embedded in a non-sequential, randomized order for security.
- **File Length Header**: Stores file size metadata in pixel (0,0) to aid in extraction.
- **Seamless Encoding & Decoding**: Provides a simple CLI-based workflow for embedding and extracting files.

## How It Works

### Encoding Process
1. Convert the image to **RGBA** format.
2. Read the file to be encoded.
3. Generate a **seed**, encrypt it with RSA, and store it in the image.
4. Shuffle available pixels based on the encrypted seed.
5. Embed file bytes into randomized pixel locations.

### Decoding Process
1. Read the file length from the header pixel (0,0).
2. Decrypt the seed using the **private key**.
3. Reconstruct the shuffled pixel order.
4. Extract the hidden file bytes from the image.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**: Core programming language.
- **Pillow**: Image processing library.
- **RSA Library**: Handles encryption and decryption.

## Usage

### Installation
Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install Pillow rsa
```

### Key Generation
```bash
python keygen.py
```
*Generates `example_public.pem` and `example_private.pem`.*

### Encoding a File into an Image
```bash
python encoder.py --file secret.txt --image input.png --key example_public.pem
```
*Outputs `encoded_input.png` containing the hidden data.*

### Decoding the File
```bash
python decoder.py --image encoded_input.png --output output.txt --key example_private.pem
```
*Retrieves the original file from the image.*

## Challenges and Learnings

One challenge was **ensuring security while keeping the image visually unchanged**. Encoding large files can make steganography more detectable, so optimizing the distribution pattern was key. Additionally, managing cross-platform compatibility and efficient decryption were important aspects of development.

## Security Considerations

While CRIS enhances security by encrypting embedded data, steganography is not foolproof against advanced forensic techniques. The more data encoded into an image, the more noticeable the alterations may become. This project serves as a **demonstration of encryption-enhanced steganography**, rather than a bulletproof security solution.

## Outcome

CRIS provides a **simple yet powerful** tool for embedding encrypted files within images. By leveraging **RSA encryption and randomized embedding**, it offers a unique approach to steganography while remaining accessible via a straightforward command-line interface.
